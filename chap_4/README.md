# Chapter 4: MPI Programming

This chapter focuses on *MPI* (Message Passing Interface) concepts through Python's mpi4py library. It includes techniques for inter-process communication, synchronization, and optimization in distributed systems.

## Project Breakdown
- *alltoall.py*: Implements all-to-all communication for exchanging data among processes.
- *broadcast.py*: Demonstrates broadcasting data to all processes in a communicator.
- *deadLockProblems.py*: Explains strategies to identify and avoid deadlocks during communication.
- *gather.py*: Collects partial results from multiple processes and aggregates them in a single process.
- *point_to_point_communication.py*: Example of direct message passing between processes.
- *reduction.py*: Shows how to perform reduction operations such as summing or finding the maximum of distributed data.
- *scatter.py*: Distributes chunks of data to different processes for parallel computation.
- *virtualTopology.py*: Explores the creation and use of virtual process topologies.
