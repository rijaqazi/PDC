# Chapter 4: MPI Programming

This chapter focuses on *MPI* (Message Passing Interface) concepts through Python's mpi4py library. It includes techniques for inter-process communication, synchronization, and optimization in distributed systems.

## Project Breakdown
- *alltoall.py*: Implements all-to-all communication for exchanging data among processes.

- *broadcast.py*: Demonstrates broadcasting data to all processes in a communicator.

- *deadLockProblems.py*: Explains strategies to identify and avoid deadlocks during communication.
