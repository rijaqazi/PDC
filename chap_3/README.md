# Chapter 3: Multiprocessing

This chapter demonstrates the use of Python's *multiprocessing* module for parallel processing. It explores how to manage processes, exchange data between them, and synchronize operations efficiently.

## Project Breakdown
- *communicating_with_pipe.py*: Demonstrates inter-process communication using pipes.
- *communicating_with_queue.py*: Showcases communication between processes using queues.
- *derom.py*: Illustrates additional utilities for multiprocessing.
- *killing_processes.py*: Explains how to terminate processes gracefully.
- *myFunc.py*: Contains helper functions used across various scripts.
- *naming_processes.py*: Assigns custom names to processes for better debugging.
- *point_to_point_communication.py*: Demonstrates point-to-point communication patterns.
- *process_in_subclass.py*: Defines processes using subclasses.
- *process_pool.py*: Utilizes process pools for task management.
- *processes_barrier.py*: Shows how to synchronize processes using barriers.
- *run_background_processes.py*: Runs processes as background tasks.
- *run_background_processes_no_daemons.py*: Runs background processes without daemonic behavior.
- *spawning_processes.py*: Demonstrates how to create new processes.
- *spawning_processes_namespace.py*: Introduces namespaces for managing shared state.
