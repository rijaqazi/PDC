# Chapter 2: Threading

This chapter demonstrates the fundamentals and techniques of *Threading* in Python. It covers the basic concepts of threads, synchronization, and thread communication.

## Fundamentals of Threads
- Understanding threads and their purpose.
- Creating and managing threads.
- Identifying the active thread in a program.
- Extending threads via subclassing.

## Techniques for Synchronizing Threads
- *Locks* for mutual exclusion.
- *Recursive Locks (RLock)* for nested threading.
- *Semaphores* to control access limits.
- *Conditions* for thread coordination.
- *Events* for signaling between threads.
- *Barriers* for synchronizing multiple threads.

## Thread Communication
- Using the *Queue* module for safe inter-thread data sharing.

## Core Topics Explored
1. *Thread Lifecycle and Management*  
   Learn how to efficiently create, start, and manage threads for multitasking.
2. *Avoiding Concurrency Pitfalls*  
   Address common threading issues like race conditions and deadlocks with:
   - Locks: Ensuring exclusive access to resources.
   - RLocks: Recursive locking for reentrant thread access.
   - Semaphores: Managing limited resource access.
   - Conditions: Coordinating threads with wait-notify mechanisms.
   - Events: Simple signaling for thread communication.
   - Barriers: Synchronization checkpoints for threads.
3. *Inter-Thread Communication*  
   Enable threads to safely exchange data using *Queue*, avoiding manual synchronization headaches.
