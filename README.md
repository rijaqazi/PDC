## Overview

Parallel and distributed computing are essential for solving complex computational problems by executing tasks concurrently, thereby reducing processing time and enhancing performance. This repository is designed to introduce and demonstrate various techniques for parallel computing using Python.

The content is structured in chapters, each focusing on a different approach to parallel programming in Python.

## Chapters

### Chapter 1: Getting Started with Parallel Computing and Python
This chapter provides an overview of parallel programming architectures and programming models. It introduces the Python programming language and highlights its features, such as its ease of use, extensibility, and the rich set of libraries and applications available. Python is an ideal tool for parallel computing due to its versatility and ease of learning.

### Chapter 2: Thread-Based Parallelism
This chapter discusses thread parallelism using Python’s threading module. You will learn how to create and manage threads, synchronize them, and implement multithreading applications through comprehensive programming examples.

### Chapter 3: Process-Based Parallelism
This chapter focuses on process-based parallelism, utilizing Python’s multiprocessing module. It provides complete examples that demonstrate how to parallelize tasks using multiple processes to enhance performance.

### Chapter 4: Message Passing
This chapter covers message-passing communication systems. The focus is on the mpi4py library, which enables message-passing programming for distributed computing. Numerous examples are provided to demonstrate how message passing can be used for inter-process communication across multiple nodes.

### Chapter 5: Asynchronous Programming
Asynchronous programming simplifies concurrent execution by allowing tasks to explicitly relinquish control rather than being suspended. This chapter explains how asynchronous programming works and introduces Python’s asyncio module. Through examples, you will learn how to manage asynchronous tasks, providing efficient execution for I/O-bound tasks.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- threading module
- multiprocessing module
- concurrent.futures
- asyncio
- mpi4py (Message Passing Interface for Python)
- dask (for distributed computing)
