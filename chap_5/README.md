# Chapter 5: Asynchronous Programming

This chapter provides examples of *Asynchronous Programming* using Python's asyncio and concurrent.futures modules. The focus is on understanding the asynchronous execution model and utilizing it to build efficient, single-threaded concurrent applications.

## Project Breakdown
- *concurrent_futures_pooling.py*: Highlights pooling techniques with concurrent.futures.
- *coroutine.py*: Simplifies coroutine handling in async workflows.
- *dealing.py*: Explains advanced async techniques for managing tasks.
- *event_loops.py*: A deeper dive into event loop operations.
- *manipulating_task.py*: Practical examples of task manipulation using asyncio.
