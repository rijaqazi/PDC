# Python Code Examples

## Code 1: Basic Calculator
A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

This example demonstrates how to take user input and perform calculations based on the selected operation.

## Code 2: Dictionary Example
An example demonstrating how to create and use dictionaries (key-value pairs) in Python:

Define a dictionary with sample key-value pairs.

Access and update dictionary values.

Add and remove elements from a dictionary.

This example helps understand the flexibility and power of dictionaries in Python.

## Code 3: Function Example
A demonstration of how to define and use functions:

Simple functions with no parameters.

Functions with parameters to perform dynamic operations.

Return values from functions.

Functions are essential for code reusability and better structure in Python programs.

## Code 4: Classes Example
An introduction to object-oriented programming using classes:

How to create a class in Python.

Defining attributes and methods within a class.

Instantiating objects from a class and using their methods and attributes.

This example lays the foundation for understanding classes and objects, a core concept in Python programming.
